Hello! This project is the first attempt at creating a basic webpage with basic knowledge of HTML. 
The more I practice in real time, the faster I will learn, I believe.
The goal is not only to create the first website, but to truly learn the foundations of this language.

This will be a simple recipe webpage, so it will have links, pictures and more.
